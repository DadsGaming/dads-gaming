<p><img src="http://ireofpurgatory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/The-Last-of-Us.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I can’t name many games out there that actually can bring a tear to my eye, make me jump out of my chair, or even make me become remotely attached to the characters.  One game that does this better than most is <strong>The Last of Us</strong>, Naughty Dog really delivered the <em>feels</em> with this game.</p>

<p><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/7e3e420e65bf6d98e7b1584cb4db169c/tumblr_n13zn2AiuP1rr1goso2_250.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>When <strong>The Last of Us</strong> launched last year (June 14th 2013) I was already overly excited for the game. Now, keep in mind I only own my PS3/PS4 for their exclusives, other than that all my games are bought on Xbox.  But there is a very good reason I spend hundreds on Playstation consoles and accessories, when these exclusives do come out they are <strong>ALWAYS</strong> a-fucking-mazing.  Not one Xbox fanboy can deny the fact they wished this stellar title was part of Xbox’s game library and they couldn’t be more right.</p>

<p>A year after the initial PS3 launch <strong>The Last of Us Remastered</strong> is every bit of what it was last year running at 60 FPS in full 1080p.  The Remastered version also utilizes High Resolution textures that really make the already stunningly beautiful game on PS3 even more jaw dropping on PS4.  The devs also smartly included an option to lock the frame rate down to 30 FPS, which I honestly could not even look at after experiencing this masterpiece in its full 60 FPS glory.  I recommend everyone who plays this to try it once, you will be surprised by the difference it makes.</p>

<p>The gameplay and story remain the same as the PS3 version minus the control scheme for aiming and shooting, Naughty Dog took advantage of the PS4’s redesigned Dual Shock controller’s new trigger buttons.  L2 now aims and R2 shoots, whereas on the PS3 version L1 Aimed and R1 shot.  Other than that the game remains largely unchanged, however the Remastered version does include the Ellie DLC <strong>Left Behind</strong> and the multiplayer maps that the PS3 version received through updates throughout the year.</p>

<p>Now lets dive into exactly what makes <strong>The Last of Us Remastered</strong> a must play game for every dad/gamer out there, the characters themselves.  A developer can make a game as beautiful as they want but if the characters aren’t driving the story, the game and its great graphics ultimately doesn’t mean jack shit. Fair warning to all, my Review does contain some spoilers, so read at your own risk.</p>

<p>I feel that I really need to detail the importance of the opening sequence in  <strong>The Last of Us</strong>, as it really is the set piece to how you perceive the rest of the game. When you start the game off you are introduced to Joel and his daughter Sarah in their home in the suburbs.  Naughty dog does a really great job of showing the bond between Joel and Sarah, after some banter Sarah lays down next to Joel on the couch and falls asleep. In a display of normal fatherly acts of heroism, Joel carries Sarah up to bed. When you actually start to control the game you are playing as Sarah and awoken by Joel’s brother Tommy calling trying to hunt Joel down.  Naughty Dog sets the somber tone with this opening, Sarah stumbles groggily through her home which itself really gives you the feeling of living in a “just before the end of the world” type era.  The world is littered with all the items we take for granted today, televisions work, cell phones ringing, hell just electricity in general. </p>

<p>When Sarah wanders into her father’s home office he comes bursting through the sliding glass door searching for his gun yelling at Sarah to stay back.  Moments later you are introduced to one of the early infected next door neighbors, Jimmy, who begins to aggressively slam his body into the glass until it finally gives showering the room with shards of glass.  Joel instinctively then blows poor Jimmy’s brains all over their home office causing Sarah to question why her father had just shot the neighbor. Killing other people obviously isn’t the norm for Sarah at this point which is a drastic change from the main character, Ellie.  But more on Ellie later, Sarah and Joel meet up with Tommy parked out front waiting for them to make their escape from the area.  The ride is full of vibrant scenes that depict the panic and chaos that is going on in the world all of a sudden.  The opening is working towards its close which has one of the most dramatic and heart touching moments I have personally ever experienced in all my years of gaming.  If you are one of those unfortunate folks that never got to experience the game I wont spoil it for you here, unless you click below that is.</p>

<p><a href="/spoiler" title="The Last of Us Remastered">Joel, Sarah, and Tommy are speeding down the street when unexpectedly they get t-boned by another vehicle trying to flee the city causing Tommy’s Jeep to go tumbling. Once Joel emerges from the vehicle and reaches to get Sarah out we find out that Sarah has possibly broken her leg and can not walk on her own.  Joel scoops his daughter up and runs her through the city trying to escape the crazed infected until they finally reach the military blockade.  Get ready for some feels here,  the military opens fire on helpless father and wounded daughter.  The acting here was incredible all parts, really felt like you had lost your own daughter and could feel the pain that Joel was feeling holding his dying daughter.</a></p>

<p>I’m not going to go into a whole lot of detail on the rest of the game now, but considering I feel the beginning of the game really is the back-drop for who Joel really becomes and how he interacts with the people he comes across.  The rest of the game is set 20 years in the future in a completely desolated United States.  Think in terms of <strong>I am Legend</strong> kind of environment…</p>

<p><img src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/324b3b068ad54f4b1b671f92ff3dd089/tumblr_mq18g3Nle51szzznmo8_400.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Joel has come to partner with Tess to become somewhat renown smugglers that can pretty much get anything in or out of the quarantined city that survivors are now forced to stay in for their own safety.  When the shipment of guns that they had paid for never arrives they set out to the find Robert.  Robert is an arms dealer that is has had a rocky relationship with Joel and Tess for awhile.  When they finally locate Robert they learn that he sold the guns to the Fireflies, a group of revolutionaries led by a woman named Marlene. Now I know we are going into a lot of names here, but we are almost done just got get a build up to how Ellie even comes into play.  Marlene and the fireflies have come across a girl named Ellie who was bitten over 3 weeks ago by an infected.  When you are bitten by an infected you turn into one with hours, so 3 weeks with no symptoms is a HUGE deal here.  The problem here is that the government is starting to wipe out the Fireflies left and right and now they have no one to smuggle Ellie out of the city and across the country to a group of doctors waiting for her to run tests.  This is where Joel and Tess come into play, Marlene offers to give them all their guns back plus more if they get Ellie out of the city to safety. </p>

<p>This is where the game picks up and you find yourself amongst the infected, sneaky, killing, and just escaping the horror that presents itself around every corner.  Along the way you are treated with amazing talks with Ellie, who is a young woman who never found herself with the luxuries we take for granted each day.  She has never seen a tv show, a movie, played with a cell phone.  It makes taking her on this journey all the more entertaining because when she sees these relics of the past it brings out the true shine of the acting here.</p>

<p>When all is said and done, after you finish your journey with Ellie and Joel you too will hopefully feel what I felt.  I was sad that my journey with them had come to an end, I wanted the story to continue on and tell me where the future left the 2 but I could not have been happier to even experience the journey at all.  Do yourself a favor, pick it up if you can, go to a friends house if you can, hell watch the game on twitch if you have to.  You never know, we too could end up in a post apocalyptic world and well… if that happens you would have missed your chance to play one of the best games of all time.</p>
