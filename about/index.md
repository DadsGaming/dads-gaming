## About us ##
 
We are Dads Gaming community founded on friendships made online while playing console games. These friendships of Dads turned into Brotherhood.


Playing online can be intimidating or frustrating at times because online match matching and public lobbies can drag you in with other players who can ruin your gaming experience. We encourage Dads to get together and play together, to enhance a Dads' online experience. More and more games nowadays are multi-player only, this makes it even more important to surround yourself with fellow, like-minded, Dads who understand that family comes first and that your gaming time is limited and want to make the most out it.
