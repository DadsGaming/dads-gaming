Dads Gaming has had the pleasure of working with Operation Supply Drop for the last three years in different capacities. 

We began three years ago with a week long stream that spanned Sunday to Saturday. To see the amount of growth from that time to now in both the OSD organization and our involvement stuns this writer. We have raised over $1k through donations and T-Shirts. Even some our own Dadâ€™s Gaming members who are also veterans have seen their lives impacted by working with OSD in their own areas. 

To show some of the incredible work that OSD has been doing this last year look no further because we have some stories for you to check out. In April of this year they sent a deployment overseas to troops from Lexington, KY (Go Cats) and Austin Texas. Supplies for this drop came from Starbucks, Microsoft, Disgruntled Decks, USAA, GAEMS and other OSD partners. In March they dropped a payload for the 10th Mountain Troops and a multinational conglomerate of forces. Just days before this, the 3/2 Calvary Regiment deployed to Poland received a drop as well. Endeavors like these take time and money. Many of our members have no time to go and participate in these drops themselves, but have the finances to aid others in making this happen.
