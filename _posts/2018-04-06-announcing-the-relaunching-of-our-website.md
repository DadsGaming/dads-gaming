I am pleased to announce the relaunching of our website with a brand new look! After two months of hard work and dedication, I am delighted to officially announce the launch on April 6, 2018. The new site launch is available and the URL is [www.dadsgaming.com](http://www.dadsgaming.com)

The goal with this newly designed website is to provide our visitors an easier way to learn about our Dads Gaming community and also allow visitors to browse our information and blogs simply from their computer or mobile device. The website now offers a more fluid and consistant design as well as better access to About Us, Team Page, Blog, Events, Support, Search, and Registration web pages. Categories, Tags, and Archives are now available in the blog section to quickly find related articles.

Among the these new features, the site contains integrated social media buttons for Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest to foster sharing and links to all of our socials for improved communication with our current and perspective members.

Going forward, we will continue to communicate regularly through our blogs and provide new articles, helpful information, highlights of new projects, and notifications.

I hope you find the new website with a fresh look, easy to access information and I also wish our site become a daily source of information for those who visit.

I'm really proud of the new website and feel it will create the experience youâ€™re looking for when you visit.

Thank you,
<p><em>Renovatio 42</em></p>
