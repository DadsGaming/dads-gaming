summary: "There arenâ€™t many things I adore more in life than filling Bandits with so many bullets that they explode, hunting down rare loot chests, or taking down Raid Bosses.  Well... there is one thing I love more,  the ability to do this on my couch while my wife is trying to kill me by watching The Bachelorette for 3 hours.  Borderlands 2 on the PS Vita a little gift from above that helps me retain my sanity in these troubling times known as 'compromise'."
