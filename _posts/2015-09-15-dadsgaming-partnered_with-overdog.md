We are pleased to annouce that [Dads Gaming](http://dadsgaming.com/) has partnered with [Overdog](http://www.overdog.com/), a platform service that enables us to connect our virtual selves with our real-life interests (e.g. games, movies, sports, dadhood) which provides better matches with online Dad gamers with simular interests.

More and more games nowadays are multi-player only, this makes it even more important to surround yourself with fellow, like-minded, Dads who understand that family comes first, that your gaming time is limited, and you want to make the most out it. As Dads gaming online we know how it can be intimidating or frustrating at times because online match matching and public lobbies can drag you in with other players who can ruin your gaming experience. We encourage Dads to get together and play together, to enhance a Dads' online experience. Overdog helps provide our Dads Gaming Community with an easy way to connect with our fellow Dads who share the same interests and passions for console video games!


##### When to use Overdog?

Often is the answer. 

After turning on your console, open the Overdog app and see matched profiles of gamers who were found with simular interests including those who are part of our Dads Gaming Community. From there you can send them a message or game invite, even if they are not yet on your friends list!

##### How to get started?

##### How to get envolved?
