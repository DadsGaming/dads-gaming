Dadsgaming.com, reddit.com/r/dadsgaming, and Twitter are great ways to interact with DG members, but the best way to stay in regular conversation about all things Dads Gaming related is to jump into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/0nEWIGLTXsyklVzL). Here you’ll find DG members in various rooms dedicated to your favorite games and communities. We have space for big titles like Destiny, Call of Duty, Battlefield, The Division, Halo, and many more. 

### What is Discord?

If you have never used Discord before it functions similarly to a large group chat with several secondary rooms dedicated to carrying on your important gaming conversations. Not only do we have rooms dedicated to your favorite games, but we also have rooms dedicated to live streaming, gaming genres, and various other rabbit holes to discover. Simply [register yourself](http://dadsgaming.com/register/), then click the [link](https://discord.gg/0nEWIGLTXsyklVzL) and begin your adventure with Dads Gaming! Afraid you’ll miss an important reddit post? Fear not! In Discord we have faithful bots present to ensure that you never miss your favorite redditors in action as well. Administrators and Community managers have special announcements that arrive directly to our chat so you don’t miss out on community game nights as well as new adventures like our Operation Supply Drop incoming May 2016.

### Voice Channels for Game Nights

Sometimes you have those nights where a party just isn’t quite big enough. Luckily, when a DG party comes together we can now use Discord Voice chat lobbies to link people from different platforms together! General chat can be a great place to meet other gamers before breaking out into your new venture as a Discord member. If the general chat lobby is too fool make sure to check out the different game rooms for ample space to fulfill your needs. Voice chat will be great for those nights when you simply cannot stand to go another moment without hearing from your cross platform buddies.

### Can I Receive Notifications?

One of the greatest parts of Discord is the ability to tailor what you want to see and when. You may choose to receive notifications whenever you are mentioned, whenever anyone speaks, or never! It is up to you to determine how plugged in you would like to be. Players also have the ability to mute certain rooms even if the *everyone* tag is used. A proper example for this might be for someone who only has an Xbox and wishes to hide the Playstation associated rooms. Simply select the room and mute it from the front page and *boom!* you’re done. Was that not easy?

### Does Discord Have a Mobile App?

Yes! Currently Discord supports both iOS and Android operating systems as well as desktop and browser interfaces. Stay connected when and where you want. 

* [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-for-gamers/id985746746?mt=8)
* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord)
* [Mac OS X Or Windows](https://discordapp.com/apps)

### Summary

Discord is a new way we at Dads Gaming are trying to bring fathers from all across the globe together. Dads Gaming members are better served when no one is left alone to game with pubs. We hope that you can find your way easy enough but if you struggle, please be sure to visit our multiple media outlets for support at [Twitter](twitter.com/dadgamers), [Reddit](reddit.com/r/dadsgaming), and our [Website](dadsgaming.com). From there we can direct you to the right place!
