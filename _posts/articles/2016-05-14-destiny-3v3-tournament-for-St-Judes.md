##May 10th through May 31st Dads Gaming will be playing a Destiny 3v3 Tournament for St. Judes

Destiny Dads (DadsGaming) is putting together a, Destiny, 3v3 tournament with all donations going to St. Jude's Children's Hospital. I know a few DADs that have benefited directly by this great charity and we're doing our small part to repay them. DADs gaming is a community of fathers, focused on getting the most out of their limited playing time. We are all about fun and understand that we may need to quit, mid-game, to attend to the family. We welcome all positive and like minded DADs and have several games and forms of contact.

All of us are DADs and love our children and hate cancer, St. Judes is the perfect charity for this event. A lot of us will be donating money as an "entry fee" of sorts and the winning teams (one on either console) will donate the fund in their name. Winners will also get featured on our website, here.

We Thank You in advance for all your donations and appreciate you taking the time to read this. Due to our mixed playing times, match times and days will be posted no less than 2 days before. Stream channels and multi-twitch links will be provided with these match times. Finals will take place on May 31st, time to follow. See our link below for details on the tournament.
