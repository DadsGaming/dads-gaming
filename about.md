## Chemical Winter ##

Hey there Dads and gamers! My Gamertag is Chemical Winter and my PSN ID is RJism, You can generally find me when I'm not working on one of those tags if not both. I'm an avid gamer and try to play most new releases on release day (doesn't always happen). Other news about me, I am currently in the middle of a move down the street, about to have a little girl named Baylee, and will be streaming frequently.

Hey! Glad you reached our site! 
I'm a Xbox (GT: Cypherapoc) gamer. I love to laugh(alot if possible) Cool tech toys & gadgets, long walks on the beach and the most important thing in life- the nectar from those sweet, sweet beans- Coffee beans that is. Gotta have 'em! ****Thanks for joining the ride with us.**** Shoot, excuse me, and I love my family- alot.(ssheese I almost forget to say that!)


## JCJesse ##

I'm an admitted Pop-Culture junkie that feeds on nostalgia. If I could only read one book ever it would be Ready Player One. When my kids starting asking me to play Joust instead of Skylanders I knew I taught them well.

Breakfast I can pass on, but coffee I won't EVER. I'm a bit a coffee and craft beer snob, my liquid joys. I also enjoy high-tech and low-tech things.
