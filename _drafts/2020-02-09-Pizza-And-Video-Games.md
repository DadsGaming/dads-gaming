I remember running home from school throwing down my backpack, then searching the entire house for any quarters and the money my grandma gave me the day before. Then I’d lace up my shoes and hop on my bike headed as fast as I could to pick up my best friend. Together, we went down to the nearest Pizza Parlor. *Nick’s Pizza* was a local hangout by all the neighborhood kids.

# Happy National Pizza Day!

Nick’s Pizza was a unique pizza place, fundamentally different era of slicedom from the time, it was a large open building sandwiched between a grocery store and hardware store. Perfect for people on the move and needed to grab a slice of pizza. This family favorite parlor, offered fresh hand-tossed pizza was served at the casual atmosphere at Nick’s Pizza. The double doors led you into a dark, large spacious room with long tables on the right, glowing arcades on the left, and the only bright light was the from the open kitchen in the back. Like a moth to the fire, you’d be drawn into either the arcades or kitchen counter depending on your need to satisfy your craving to game or hunger. The restaurant offered a small and simple variety of toppings for a whole or slice of pizza. Some other neighborhood pizzerias would under-bake their pizza pie somewhat, then add toppings and more cheese then reheat it in the oven. The end product from another pizzeria tasted like an old pizza with new toppings. Nick’s Pizza was always busy, so you’re all but guaranteed a fresh slice that hasn’t been sitting.

As true to its form, its sliced into a triangle from freshly baked whole pizza pie. The slice is served to you on a paper plate, but the slice is bigger than the plate. You get a good slice with a thin, crisp crust, flavorful marinara sauce that’s well-balanced, and good-quality mozzarella cheese that creamy and not rubbery. The crust has a good coloration - a golden-brown to a dark-brown hue tells you the dough was likely fermented properly, yielding its good flavor. Perfection every time!

The slice of Nick’s Pizza was perfect for me because it was one-dollar and twenty-five cents and I always got seventy-five cents back in quarters after paying with two one-dollar bills. The owner Nick and his brother both knew me, I’d walk-up to the counter that was high above my head and for the workers only chest high. Waving my money so they could see me. I had the perfect method of ordering my slice of cheese pizza: not only because I would get quarters in change but I also told them to “take their time” too and they knew that I wanted to at least a half an hour to explore the games.The only rule at Nick’s Pizza was there’s eating or drinking near the games.

They had arcade games of all kinds.


## Legendary Wings

My best friend was way better at playing Legendary Wings than me. The coin operated version of Legendary Wings by Capcom allowed two players to simultaneously play, the second player can drop-in and and join at anytime or even continue after the game was over. Two player co-op was fun and it was the best of its kind. Co-op in Legendary Wings was great for me, since my friend’s session would run longer than mine. It allowed the flexibility for me to play another game or go eat pizza and jump back in to help some more at any point of the game. No waiting.

Legendary Wings wasn’t just hard or difficult, its obnoxious difficulty!

### Story

The heroes are two mythological angels on a mission to ensure mankind’s survival and destroy “Dark”, an alien supercomputer. “Dark” at first appears to be helping human civilization achieve a new state of enlightenment since ancient times, then suddenly goes nuts and rebels against mankind. With a name like “Dark”, of course he was going to turn against you!

### Gameplay

What was unique about Legendary Wings was depending on the level in the game had two different playing styles: The first was a top-down vertical scrolling part when both players would fly around the sky attacking the enemies in the air and ground, using your lazer guns and bombs. The second part began after defeating a boss guardian and gaining access to the palace entrance, where the game switched to a side-scrolling view with platforming elements.

The controls used an 8-way joystick and two buttons, all contextual and changes depending on which part of the game you’re in. These two distinct gaming styles were very eye catching to anyone walking by or watching, some people would do a double-take thinking the game was replaced because the two modes were so different visually.

Uniquely, Legendary Wings game design was a mix between ancient ruins you might see in *Indiana Jones* and futuristic weapons you’d see in a science fiction like *Star Wars*.

Powerups - large letter “P” dropped by the enemy - would protect you and increase your weapon spread and damage at each upgrade level. The last powerup made you into a Fiery Phoenix type of creature that was able to withstand up-to three hits by enemy fire before dying. A significant enemy hit would revert your character back to the state before the last powerup, decreasing your weapon type and damage to the state it was before.

At the time, Legendary Wings presented unique elements you’ve never seen a game before. It made going to arcades, for me Nick’s Pizza Parlor, more exciting.
